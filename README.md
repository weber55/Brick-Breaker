# Gameplay Instructions
Assuming one is in the same directory as /home/ugrads/weber/Weber-Carlile-fxgame/ then you can use the command ./sbt run to run the brick breakter game. Once the scene pops up, the user can begin the game by pressing the space bar twice and then using the left and right arrows to move the paddle back and forth. The goal is to hit the bricks until they "break" or disappear without letting the ball fall. If the ball falls, the ball will reset and the user has to press the space bar once to begin again. Once a brick breaks, the score will be updated by one point. The higher the score the better. If the user breaks all bricks, they continue to the next level. There are three levels and then they win the game.
